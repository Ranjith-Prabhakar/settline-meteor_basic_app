*.basically meteor has a well folder structure
*.codes written in client folder is the only code will be available to the browser
*.so as the codes written in the folder server will be accessible only in the server side 
*.codes written out of these folders will be shared by both still there are folders those couldn't be accessible by either client or server
*.assets and styles written in the public folder is only accessible by client side codes and also we dont want to put the public directory
  while using the path
*.assets and codes in the privet repository is specifically for server
*.meteor follows a lazy evaluation as well as eager/greedy evaluation 
*.for lazy evalution it follows a folder structure no modules inside of the import folder will be bundled but send to when they needed 
 if any other files imports any of the functions/objects/variables from this modules only they will
 send to 
*.we can't import any data from any modules which are written inside the server folder to any modules 
  which is written inside the client folder VICE VERSA 
*.even if there folders having names like server or clinent inside the import the rule will be applied 
  on them too
*. in the server side code meteor follows a syncronous style using  only single thread, which is a little diff than the usuall
   async callback/async/await pattern but behind the hood using fiber meteor manages the concurrency very well
